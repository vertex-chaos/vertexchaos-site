## The situation
Document updates were repetitive and error-prone: the kind of work that should be done by a script, not a person with a deadline.

## What I delivered
- Automated updates to Word documents based on defined rules
- Consistent formatting normalization (the “why is this font different?” problem)
- Logging and guardrails to avoid damaging source files
- A small runbook so someone else can run it without summoning me

## Outcome
- Faster document turnaround with fewer mistakes
- Consistent formatting across outputs
- Reduced operator effort for recurring updates
